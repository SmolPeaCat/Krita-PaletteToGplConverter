# Krita-PaletteToGplConverter

My first Krita plugin. Converts a chosen palette into .gpl file

The goal of this plugin is to easily convert your color palettes into .gpl files,  
since I did not find any easy way to convert my color palette into a gpl file to use in inkscape, I made a solution :)

Hope you like it !

## How to install

Download by clicking Code on top and Download ZIP, then follow the instructions shown here:

[Krita Docs - Managing Python plugins](https://docs.krita.org/en/user_manual/python_scripting/install_custom_python_plugin.html)

## How to use

Features :

- Convert Button

Convert the selected palette into a .gpl file

That is it !

### Side note

The colors may or may not be totaly accurate, since I'm converting float values into integers But they looked fine when I checked.
